# In the shadows
A tiny game where the objective is to find the exit before you run of of flashlight batteries. Move the player with 
the arrow keys and toggle the flashlight with space.

## What is this?
My first experiment with [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), [Box2D](http://box2d.org/) 
and [Box2DLights](https://github.com/libgdx/box2dlights). Developed during the [Athega](http://athega.se) 2015 codebase.
